**easypubsub** is a simple wrapper around [PyZMQ](https://pyzmq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) that provides an easy interface to the *PubSub* (Publish-Subscribe) functionality of [ZeroMQ](https://zeromq.org/). 

In PubSub, a *publisher* publishes a message to a *topic* and a *subscriber* subscribes to that topic and receives the message. In easypubsub, publishers and subscribers connect to each other via a *proxy*, which acts as intermediary between them.
For more information regarding *PubSub*, see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern).
